                <!-- Early life -->
                <p class="text">Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5th, 1941 in Tokyo, Japan. He was born to an aircraft
                    parts manufacturer, Katsuji Miyazaki, who worked at the family business Miyazaki Airplanes. He was
                    one of four sons, with his only older brother being Arata Miyazaki, and his two younger brothers
                    being Yutaka Miyazaki and Shirou Miyazaki. In 1944, when Hayao was three, his father moved the
                    family to Utsunomiya City to escape the American bombing of Tokyo, and the family remained there for
                    two years, until 1946. Hayao attended three different grade schools between 1947 and 1952. His
                    mother became sick with spinal tuberculosis from 1947 to 1955, and was in a hospital for the first
                    few of those years. In 1955, Hayao graduated elementary school and went on to attend Omiya Junior
                    High. He graduated from Omiya Junior High in 1958 and went on to attend a public high school,
                    Toyotama High, until 1962, when he graduated high school and entered university. While at Gakushuin
                    University, he majored in economics and graduated with degrees in economics and political science.

                <!-- Career in animation -->
                <p class="text">Some might wonder, given that he didn’t go to university for animation, how exactly his
                    career in animation got started. Hayao wasn’t always interested in animating; he saw his first
                    feature-length color anime, Hakujaden, in his third year of high school, and decided he wanted to be
                    a comic artist. After graduating university, Hayo landed a job at Toei Animation, where he trained
                    for three months and became an inbetweener, someone who draws the intermediate frames between two
                    images. It is here that his career in animation got started. In 1968, the first film Hayao Miyazaki
                    played a major role in making came out; that movie was Prince of the Sun, which he worked on with
                    director Isao Takahata, who would later be a producer for some of Hayao’s own movies. In 1971, Hayao
                    left Toei Animation and joined A-Pro with Takahata and Yoichi Otabe. Two years later, in 1973, the
                    team quit A-Pro and joined Zuiyo Pictures, where he worked on Heidi: Girl of the Alps and Three
                    Thousand Miles in Search of Mother. In 1983, he began working on the Nausicaa of the Valley of the
                    Wind film, and in 1984, he and Takahata opened their own office. Finally, in 1985, Hayao helped
                    found Studio Ghibli, which would go on to cement his name as a truly famous animator.</p>

            <h1>Hayao Miyazaki's Work</h1>
            <!-- Hayao Miyazaki's animated films -->
            <p class="text">Hayao Miyazaki is most well-known for his animated movies, which hold a special place in
                many people’s hearts. He both directed and was screenwriter for the films Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor
                Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Porco Russo, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle,
                Ponyo, The Wind Rises, and How Do You Live, an upcoming film. He was screenwriter on Whisper of the
                Heart, Arrietty, From Up on Poppy Hill, and Earwig and the Witch. Princess Mononoke was the
                highest-grossing film in Japan in 1997 following its release, and was the first animated film to win the
                Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year. Spirited Away, released in 2001, became the
                highest-grossing film in Japanese history and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the
                75th Academy Awards. Of the top ten highest-grossing animated films, five are movies that Miyazaki wrote
                and directed, and one is a movie that he wrote but did not direct. Below are some images from two of his
                films that he wrote and directed that are in the top ten highest-grossing animated films. The top two
                are from Spirited Away and the bottom two are from Howl’s Moving Castle:</p>

            <!-- Studio Ghibli -->
            <p class="text">The majority of Hayao Miyazaki’s animated films were created at Studio Ghibli, which was
                founded on June 15th, 1985, by Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki. The name ‘Ghibli’ came
                from the Italian word ‘ghibli’, which means ‘a hot, dust-carrying wind’, with the idea being that the
                studio would “blow a new wind through the anime industry.” To its credit, that is exactly what it did,
                with six of the top ten highest-grossing animated films and eleven of the top fifty highest-grossing
                animated films being made by Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki was involved in the majority of the films produced
                by Studio Ghibli. Of the twenty-three films the studio made, nine of the films they produced were
                directed and written by him and four of the films they produced were written by him, meaning more than
                half of Studio Ghibli’s films involved Miyazaki. That number is soon to go up, as the studio has a new
                film planned that is going to be written and directed by Miyazaki. In creating Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki
                helped introduce a number of wonderful new animated movies to the world.</p>

            <h1>Hayao Miyazaki's Themes and Influence</h1>
            <!-- Themes in Hayao Miyazaki's work -->
            <p class="text">The biggest reason why Hayao Miyazaki’s movies are so incredibly popular is that they appeal
                to both adults and children. Miyazaki’s focus was on making movies the whole family could enjoy, and so
                while his films are appropriate for children, they also contain themes that adults can understand and
                appreciate. This, along with his themes, makes the films appealing to all ages. Themes that are common
                in Hayao Miyazaki’s work are those of nature, the brutality of man, and the loss of innocence. Miyazaki
                is very aware of environmental loss, and even his early film My Neighbor Totoro was, in a way, an elegy
                for a lost Japan. Many of his films, in fact, have a sense of loss, and they don’t always have perfect
                happy endings. For instance, in Princess Mononoke, the two protagonists care about each other, but the
                world is so complicated and challenging that they don’t get a happily ever after where they stay
                together forever. His films also contain complex characters. There are no strictly good or bad
                people—the bad people have some good in them, and the good people have some bad in them. He doesn’t make
                it clear-cut or easy to make decisions about people, and that is very relevant to real life, where
                things are rarely clear-cut.</p>

            <!-- Influence on animation -->
            <p class="text">His work appealing to so many and being so popular has caused Miyazaki and his work to have
                incredible influence on the animation industry. His distinctive art style and fantastical narratives are
                inspirations for many. Several directors and animators in Hollywood have been inspired by his work, the
                most notable being Guillermo del Toro. More recently, his work influenced director Wes Anderson in his
                film Isle of Dogs. Anderson said that in Miyazaki’s movies you get nature and moments of peace, which is
                a kind of rhythm that isn’t experienced in American films as much, and he sought to emulate that rhythm.
                Even after retiring, Miyazaki’s work will certainly continue to influence the works of others, making
                him truly one of the greatest animators of all time, if not the greatest animator of all time.</p>
